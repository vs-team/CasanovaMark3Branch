PARSER:
- Parse lambdas
- Parse type functions
- Parse conditionals

TYPE CHECKER:
- Check the namespace when comparing types and if it is ambiguous notify it.
- Invert the order of evaluation in the match in checkNormalizedCall in order to give highest priority to local functions
- Instead of returning an option, return a struct containing a value and a boolean saying if the value exists for performance reasons.
